👋 Hi, I’m Sujal

I build AI applications that solve real problems using clean engineering and modern LLMs.

I’m an AI / ML Engineer working with Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI, focused on turning raw data into reliable, production-ready systems.

🧠 What I Build
🔍 RAG Systems
Built a YouTube Intelligence Agent using LangChain + ChromaDB for grounded Q&A over video transcripts, significantly reducing hallucinations.

🔗 Multi-API Orchestration
Developed Morning Buddy, an AI-driven daily planner that orchestrates Weather, News, and Events APIs to generate structured Morning → Afternoon → Evening itineraries.

🖼️ Multimodal Pipelines
Created storytelling systems using Gemini Flash that combine images + text into coherent narratives, with real-time audio narration.

🛠 What I Bring

🤖 Generative AI & RAG :
Hands-on experience building RAG pipelines and LLM-orchestrated workflows using LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini, OpenAI, and HuggingFace

⚙️ Backend & Automation :
Designed robust multi-API pipelines and backend workflows using Python & FastAPI

🗄️ Databases :
Worked with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Vector DBs (ChromaDB) for semantic search

☁️ Cloud & Deployment
Deployed AI apps using Docker and AWS (EC2, Lambda), including Streamlit Cloud

🧪 Tech Stack

GenAI & LLMs: LangChain, LangGraph, RAG, Google Gemini API, OpenAI API, HuggingFace

ML & Data: NLP, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Backend & Cloud: Python, FastAPI, Docker, AWS (EC2, Lambda), SQL, Git

📈 Professional Impact

During internships at TTK Services and AdOpsGuy:

📉 Reduced manual research effort by ~40% using Python automation and AI tools

📊 Processed 50+ datasets weekly with consistent accuracy

🧩 Designed prompt strategies that produced structured, analytical outputs instead of generic LLM responses
